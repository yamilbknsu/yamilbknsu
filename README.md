# Hi, I'm Yamil 👋

I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Industrial Engineering at NC State University and a research software engineer interested building high-performance, reproducible, and open-source tools to accelerate applied research. Most of my work focuses on **geospatial data science, simulation modeling, and machine learning for risk and resilience** 

<!-- I aim to develop scalable, modular pipelines that empower both scientists and practitioners to tackle real-world challenges — from infrastructure resilience to environmental modeling. -->
